##Game Blurb
**Pumpkin Squash**

*Squash pumpkins to stay alive!*

The local graveyard's been overrun by pesky pumpkin pests! As the resident caretaker scarecrow, it's your job to keep the peace (and eerie quiet) by squashing the pumpkins before they blow up!
HOW TO PLAY

- Tap on the ground to move (tap and hold to keep moving)
- Tap on a pumpkin to punch it (keep tapping rapidly to keep punching)
- punch pumpkins to squash them! 
- You lose your health slowly over time. Squashing a pumpkin restores some of your health
- Pumpkins not squashed explode after their timer expires, dealing damage to you if you're nearby

**Advanced Tips**
- Exploding pumpkins deal more damage the less remaining health they have
- Squashing pumpkins that are about to explode restores more health

Made with Unity 4.6.1
